Add scripts in order:
- Lone Wolf Gamepad Extender
- System Settings - Cidiomar
- Vocab Settings - Cidiomar
- Cidiomar's Input System
- Sixth's Input
- Sixth's Main
- Menu Settings
- Menu Code
- Rachnera Mixed Input
- Rachnera Keybind Config

Some options of the original scripts have been disabled in an attempt to keep things (very relatively) simple, namely:
- Anything related to using a mouse has been slip under the rug
